Note on coins:

The coins are meant to represent the 5 classic coin metals of DnD, copper, silver, electrum, gold, and platinum.  Of course designers can use them for whatever they want, heirlooms, lucky coins, clues, tokens etc.

While technically not “gems”, I wanted them to make that nice “ping!” noise that gems do in the inventory.
